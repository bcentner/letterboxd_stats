2019-03-18,https://boxd.it/Fp3Ed,Swiss Army Man is an existential art film that still remains accessible for the average viewer.
2019-04-09,https://boxd.it/2O1R0,Frances Ha!
2019-09-23,https://boxd.it/ONOFh,Peripheral beauty
2019-12-21,https://boxd.it/Ui5Hf,Convoluted politics add to the charm while detracting from the modern viewing experience
2019-12-23,https://boxd.it/U47yr,So much beauty in the ocean
2019-12-30,https://boxd.it/V3xt5,I read that Shultz’ favorite album is blond
2020-01-13,https://boxd.it/Wuz2j,too self-aware maybe? I felt like the previous movies were less so
2020-02-06,https://boxd.it/YCZlb,"We are told to take our time, but do any of us have time?"
2020-02-13,https://boxd.it/ZfKKt,Plus I wish it were an hour shorter
2020-03-11,https://boxd.it/11rQoZ,and probably still like this today in some places
2020-03-25,https://boxd.it/12PxPT,Apparently I’ve already seen three...
2020-03-27,https://boxd.it/12ZtOR,Quarantine #3 (although I think it’s actually the 4th)
2020-03-28,https://boxd.it/134SEx,Quarantine #4
2020-03-28,https://boxd.it/139okH,quarantine #5 should have countless repeat viewings. This could easily end up in my “favorites” over the next month
2020-03-29,https://boxd.it/13goFf,Quarantine #6
2020-03-29,https://boxd.it/139okH,"Alright, Letterboxd is awesome for changing the star system on this one. Just noticed that"
2020-03-30,https://boxd.it/139okH,"Missed it while watching, but the internet is talking about the many visual parallels between POLF and Persona"
2020-04-06,https://boxd.it/UeWeH,Thinking about this for some reason right now. Joker is an objective mirror (no morality).
2020-04-06,https://boxd.it/14ifOP,(could not sleep bc this movie wouldn’t leave me)
2020-04-06,https://boxd.it/14ifOP,"I know that I crossed the threshold. Maybe we are being told not to analyze, but to simply believe"
2020-04-18,https://boxd.it/15Nh0N,I have absolutely no clue why I watched this. Every Lars Von Trier movie I see makes me feel like a piece of shit
2020-04-18,https://boxd.it/15Nh0N,"This one was especially personally, but still. What kind of mad man makes a film like this"
2021-02-14,https://boxd.it/UeWeH,Tarantino: the subversion is during the talk show scene... except it’s a subversion of the audiences mind. We think like the joker. We want De Niro to die
2021-03-12,https://boxd.it/1IuMRV,I’m a big sucker for filmmakers that mindprobe the audience with agressive aspect ratios

Position,Name,Year,URL,Description
1,City of God,2002,https://boxd.it/2a2a,This is the movie that introduced me to movies. The first time I realized the importance / breadth of cinema.
2,Pulp Fiction,1994,https://boxd.it/29Pq,*no explanation needed*
3,Interstellar,2014,https://boxd.it/4VZ8,"A blockbuster with that thrives on spectacle, but is ultimately motivated by humanity. Art cinema on the grandest scale.
It was a recent viewing (sometime late 2019) that I was moved by the story— a story of time, love, and space."
4,Stalker,1979,https://boxd.it/28PO,"<i>Stalker</i> is an <b>experience</b>. It is full of ideas, yet completely devoid of answers."
5,Solaris,1972,https://boxd.it/2a2Y,"I’m a sucker for philosophical science-fiction. Plus, I saw many parallels to myself"

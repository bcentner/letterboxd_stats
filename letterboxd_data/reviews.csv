2019-01-17,First Reformed,2017,https://boxd.it/C5JhD,4,,"Will God forgive? 
Will God forgive us for what we have done to Earth; For what we have to done to each other; For what we have done to ourselves? 
Toller observes the worst of humanity, bringing subdued anger to a boil inside of him. Apathy clouds over the joy of existence and eclipses any faith in the goodness of humankind. Despair pervades Toller's mind and is pumped through his heart. And it is with this despair that he is able to  achieve a selfish act of forgiveness-- a violent catharsis. For once, he puts himself first and choses to love in the midst of his pain and many burdens. 
Toller does not need God to forgive. We do not need God to forgive. The power of forgiveness comes from the individual and only the individual. 
Will we forgive?",,

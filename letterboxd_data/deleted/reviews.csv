<b>DO NOT WATCH THIS BORING ASS FILM</b>",,2018-11-13
2018-12-15,Roma,2018,https://boxd.it/A2Wlz,5,,"Easily one of the most poignant explorations into the depth of the experience of the individual. The movie flows peaceful and calming, merciless and unrelenting.¬†(Random thought: Many people view film as an escape. This masterpiece drowns your senses in another reality‚Äî immersing you in an alternate truth. Planes thunder above Cleo‚Äôs head; Riots rip through the streets; Sofia‚Äôs family falls in pieces. Admidst the heartbreak, beauty hides in the mundane‚Äî piercing and engulfing every frame.)",,2018-12-14

2019-09-30,Call Me by Your Name,2017,https://boxd.it/PdTyd,5,,"Realism at its absolute best. But truthfully, <i>Call Me By Your Name </i>is much more than that. This film¬†is nearly perfect. It is cinema at its best. Life at its best. Since my first viewing, moments and emotions have returned to me without warning. The waves of this cinema have continued to crash over me long after asking ‚ÄúIs it a video?‚Äù ¬†
So nostalgic, so brief, so true. The fire flickers and a fly buzzes around the frame. Elio knows that his pain is certainly worth it. The pain now is worth experiencing the beauty that prevailed in the moment.",,2019-08-22
